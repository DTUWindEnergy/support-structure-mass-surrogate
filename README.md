# Support Structure Mass Surrogate

Surrogate model of support structure mass


**curve_fit_monopile.py** trains surrogate models based on the output of monopile and turbine optimizations. The data is located in the **tower_mass_results.dat** file.
The surrogate is available in excel-format in the **surrrogate** folder.
